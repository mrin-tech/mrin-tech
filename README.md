### Hi, I'm Mrin! 👋

I'm a recent graduate 🎓 from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science: Computer Game Design. I have a lot of interest in software development and data science.

Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects, including game development 🎮, data analysis 🔢, and web development 🖥.  I love learning new languages and working on projects that combine the realms of technical skills and creativity. I am proficient in Python, C/C++/C#, Javascript, and SQL. 

🌟 Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories, where you'll find a mix of personal projects, course assignments, and collaborations. 

🪴 I strive to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact on the world.
